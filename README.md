### First-time Setup

PesaScope requires SMS read permission to parse M-Pesa messages. Android classifies this as a **restricted permission** and blocks it for apps installed outside the Play Store. Follow these steps to grant it:

1. Open **Settings → Apps → PesaScope → App Info**
2. Tap the **⋮ (three-dot menu)** in the top-right corner
3. Select **Allow restricted settings**
4. Go back to PesaScope and proceed through onboarding — grant the SMS permission when prompted

### Onboarding overview

| Step                                | What happens                                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Grant SMS permission                | Allows real-time capture of incoming M-Pesa messages                     |
| Set as default SMS app _(optional)_ | Required only for importing your existing M-Pesa history from your inbox |
| Restore default SMS app             | Prompted immediately after history import completes                      |

> Ongoing transaction capture works in the background without PesaScope being your default SMS app.

## Privacy

All processing happens locally on your device. PesaScope only reads messages from the `MPESA` sender. No data is transmitted or stored externally.
